# Machine learning based DoS attack detection for MQTT sensor networks
I developed this work as my master thesis at Politecnico di Milano (ANTLab)
The main aim of this master thesis work is to detect and classify DoS attacks for MQTT sensor networks. In this project, we simulate a smart home scenario to gather reliable data. By collecting the legitimate and malicious data, we propose a realistic MQTT-based dataset that contains legitimate and malicious flow-level traffic. We present online and offline machine learning solutions to detect and classify DoS attacks. Our proposed online classifiers are able to detect attacks in different flow durations to notice the trade-off between classifiers' accuracy and flow durations. As part of the evaluation of this work, we are able to successfully detect malicious and legitimate traffic as a binary classification; furthermore, our classifiers are capable to detect and classify categories of the DoS attack in a multi-value classification. Finally, we present the best classifier for each flow duration, and the trade-off between flow durations and classifiers' accuracy are discussed.
